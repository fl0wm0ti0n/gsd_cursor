# Status Normalization Report

- Baseline run date: not yet run
- Scope: append-only status normalization evidence for stories with completed
  release/state evidence but stale product status artifacts.
- Canonical owner: `docs/product/backlog.md`
- Derived views reconciled: `docs/product/acceptance.md`,
  `docs/engineering/state.md`

| Story | Prior backlog status | Prior acceptance | Resolved backlog status | Resolved acceptance | Evidence refs | Timestamp |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| (none yet) | - | - | - | - | - | - |

## Procedure notes

- This baseline is append-only; later reconciliations add delta rows only.
- Guardrail scope is target stories only. Unrelated stories are never rewritten.
- Contradictory reconciliation outcomes must fail safe with reason code
  `CANONICAL_STATUS_CONFLICT` and remediation guidance.
