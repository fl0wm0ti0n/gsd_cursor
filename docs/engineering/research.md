# Research

## Entry format (per DEC-0011)

Each research entry uses the R-xxxx ID format with semi-structured fields.

**Required fields**: ID (R-xxxx), Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Topic (short description).
**Optional fields**: Query, Sources, Findings, Linked (US-xxxx/DEC-xxxx refs),
Confidence (high/medium/low, default: medium), Status (current/outdated/superseded,
default: current).

### Auto-increment convention

Assign the next sequential R-xxxx ID by incrementing from the highest existing
entry in this file. Before creating a new entry, read this file to determine the
current highest ID.

### Cross-referencing guidance

Reference research entries by ID in other artifacts using the format "per R-xxxx".
Examples:
- In decisions: "per R-0001, prompt-level isolation is unreliable"
- In architecture: "R-0003 confirms the library supports streaming"
- In handoffs: "see R-0002 for competitor analysis"

Agents, commands, and handoffs should cite entry IDs whenever research informed
a decision or recommendation.

## R-0001

- **Date**: 2026-02-23
- **Topic**: Subagent context isolation for phase independence
- **Query**: How to guarantee independent review behavior across agent phases
- **Findings**:
  - Prompt-level instructions like "ignore prior chat" are advisory and not a
    reliable isolation boundary.
  - Artifact-first handoffs (`handoffs/*.md` + docs/sprints) already provide a
    strong context-transfer mechanism that supports hard context resets.
  - `/auto` must be orchestration-only; if it performs multi-role work in one
    context it undermines phase independence.
  - Execute/QA loops need explicit fresh-instance semantics (`dev` then `qa`,
    repeat with new instances) to preserve review integrity.
  - US-0023 validates that role switching inside one chat is not enough to
    guarantee independent review behavior. True independence requires fresh
    subagent context boundaries at each phase handoff.
- **Risks**:
  - Documentation-level enforcement can drift if future command files are added
    without the execution-model section.
  - Runtime orchestration behavior still depends on command execution discipline;
    this story hardens rules and artifacts but does not add external runtime
    enforcement code.

## R-0002

- **Date**: 2026-02-24
- **Topic**: Manifest-driven contract governance for multi-repo compatibility
- **Query**: Registry + local manifest patterns and contract-diff propagation for
  API compatibility impact analysis
- **Sources**:
  - https://backstage.io/docs/features/software-catalog
  - https://docs.pact.io/pact_broker/can_i_deploy
  - https://github.com/oasdiff/oasdiff
- **Findings**:
  - Registry-style inventory models improve cross-system discoverability when
    paired with owner-maintained local metadata.
  - Consumer/provider contract matrices support deterministic compatibility
    decisions by linking producer changes to consumer verification context.
  - API diff tooling patterns reinforce structured "change signal" reporting
    (from/to version, breaking/additive classification, and evidence links).
  - For this project, these patterns map cleanly to workflow artifacts without
    requiring runtime orchestration claims.

## R-0003

- **Date**: 2026-02-25
- **Topic**: Remote config contract safety and fail-fast validation patterns
- **Query**: Canonical JSON config contract and secure secret-handling guidance
  for optional remote execution
- **Sources**:
  - https://12factor.net/config
  - https://json-schema.org/learn/miscellaneous-examples.html
  - https://tour.json-schema.org/content/01-Getting-Started/04-Enumerated-Values
- **Findings**:
  - Environment variables are the preferred channel for deploy-varying and
    sensitive configuration; committed repo config should reference env vars,
    not include raw secrets.
  - A contract-first JSON approach with required fields and explicit enums gives
    deterministic validation and clearer failure modes.
  - For optional capabilities, mode-aware validation preserves low-friction
    defaults: strict checks only when the optional mode is explicitly enabled.

## R-0004

- **Date**: 2026-02-25
- **Topic**: Deterministic workflow resume-source precedence for `/auto` continuation
- **Query**: How should a workflow orchestrator resolve start phase safely across
  explicit operator input, resume handoff artifacts, and state fallback?
- **Sources**:
  - `.cursor/commands/auto.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/resume.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/pause.md`
  - `handoffs/resume_brief.md`
  - `docs/engineering/state.md`
  - `docs/product/backlog.md` (US-0037 ACs)
- **Findings**:
  - Deterministic behavior requires strict precedence, with explicit user intent
    (`start-from`) highest to prevent hidden inference overrides.
  - `resume_brief.md` is the strongest implicit checkpoint source when no
    explicit override exists because it is purpose-built for intended resume
    phase declaration.
  - `state.md` works as fallback only with conservative inference and explicit
    ambiguity handling; permissive parsing risks phase misrouting.
  - Safe continuation requires fail-fast on stale/conflicting sources rather
    than guessing, plus structured error codes for reproducible QA.
  - Breadcrumb fields for source, resolved phase, and stop reason are necessary
    for inspectability and post-hoc debugging of automation flow.

## R-0005

- **Date**: 2026-02-25
- **Topic**: Guarded phase-sync and deterministic release gate sequencing
- **Query**: What minimum workflow policy model enforces safe auto-sync cadence
  and no-bypass release readiness while preserving manual default behavior?
- **Sources**:
  - `docs/product/backlog.md` (US-0038 and US-0039 ACs)
  - `.cursor/commands/auto.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/execute.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/qa.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/release.md`
  - `docs/engineering/runbook.md`
  - `scripts/validate-and-push.ps1`
  - `scripts/validate-and-push.sh`
- **Findings**:
  - Existing local scripts already establish check-before-push baseline with
    tests as the critical guard; architecture should preserve this and formalize
    it as mandatory policy for any push eligibility path.
  - Safe default behavior is best preserved with non-auto sync mode
    (`manual`/`disabled`) and explicit opt-in for auto-push behavior.
  - QA-first protection for feature work is necessary to prevent early auto-push;
    before QA pass, only explicit manual sync should remain allowed.
  - Release hardening is most auditable with fixed gate order:
    check-in test evidence -> QA completion -> UAT completion -> release
    finalization.
  - Override capability should remain exception-only via explicit decision gate,
    never as default release behavior.

## R-0006

- **Date**: 2026-02-25
- **Topic**: Immutable release-note artifacts plus queue-based release lifecycle
  tracking
- **Query**: What minimal workflow model prevents release-note overwrite while
  preserving backward compatibility and deterministic unreleased/released status?
- **Sources**:
  - `docs/product/backlog.md` (US-0040 ACs)
  - `handoffs/release_notes.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/release.md`
  - `docs/engineering/state.md`
  - `docs/engineering/architecture.md`
- **Findings**:
  - Single mutable release-note artifacts are inherently overwrite-prone and
    cannot safely represent independent sprint release history.
  - Sprint-scoped notes with canonical naming (`Sxxxx-release-notes.md`) provide
    a simple immutable history boundary with low process complexity.
  - A queue index with explicit status transitions (`planned|ready|unreleased|
    released|blocked`) is required for deterministic release visibility and
    failure handling.
  - Backward compatibility is best preserved by retaining
    `handoffs/release_notes.md` as latest-pointer summary while moving canonical
    history to `handoffs/releases/`.
  - Safe behavior under ambiguity requires fail-closed transitions and explicit
    reason codes rather than automatic destructive reconciliation.

## R-0007

- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Topic**: Deterministic backlog reconciliation at release boundary
- **Query**: How should released-sprint evidence drive backlog story status/AC
  synchronization without unsafe broad mutation?
- **Sources**:
  - `docs/product/backlog.md` (US-0043 ACs)
  - `handoffs/release_queue.md`
  - `handoffs/releases/S0013-release-notes.md`
  - `sprints/S0013/release-findings.md`
  - `tests/report.md`
  - https://jfrog.com/blog/the-power-of-evidence-collection-and-release-lifecycle-management
  - https://www.tqsystems.io/blog/release-readiness-checklist
- **Findings**:
  - Evidence-first gates are more reliable than manual status edits when release
    artifacts are already canonical and deterministic.
  - Reconciliation should use strict precedence (release queue + release notes +
    QA/UAT/release-findings evidence) and remain target-sprint scoped.
  - Safe defaults require fail-closed behavior on contradictions (for example
    released sprint with OPEN story or unchecked ACs) with explicit reason code.
  - Automated reconciliation must not mutate unrelated stories; mutation scope
    should be constrained to stories linked to the target sprint.
  - Regression checks should include both stale-negative and auto-reconcile
    positive scenarios to prevent recurrence.

## R-0008

- **Date**: 2026-02-27
- **Topic**: Multi-story auto backlog drain with bounded safety controls
- **Query**: How should `/auto` continue across multiple planned stories while
  preserving deterministic checkpoints, decision gates, and operator control?
- **Sources**:
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/tutorials/workflows/checkpointing-and-resuming
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-functions/durable/durable-functions-overview

  - https://cordum.io/blog/approvals-for-autonomous-workflows
  - https://agentic-patterns.com/patterns/human-in-loop-approval-framework/
- **Findings**:
  - Safe long-running orchestration patterns use deterministic checkpoints and
    replay-safe state transitions at each completed unit of work.
  - Backlog-drain automation needs bounded run controls (for example max stories
    per run / max consecutive release attempts) to prevent runaway sessions.
  - Human/decision gates should remain enforced for high-impact or ambiguous
    changes; approvals are risk controls, not disabled by default.
  - Deterministic queue selection and explicit reason codes are necessary for
    predictable continuation when one story blocks.
  - A mode switch is required so teams can choose between story-by-story auto
    behavior and full backlog-drain behavior without changing core defaults.

## R-0009

- **Date**: 2026-02-26
- **Topic**: Canonical backlog status ownership and cross-artifact drift prevention
- **Query**: Should one artifact own story status and how should workflow enforce
  consistency across backlog, acceptance, and engineering state?
- **Sources**:
  - `docs/product/backlog.md`
  - `docs/product/acceptance.md`
  - `docs/engineering/state.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/release.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/auto.md`
  - https://martinfowler.com/articles/evodb.html
  - https://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com/patterns/messaging/CanonicalDataModel.html
- **Findings**:
  - A single canonical source for workflow status reduces contradictory outcomes
    when multiple artifacts are edited asynchronously.
  - Derived/secondary artifacts should be reconciled from canonical state at
    deterministic boundaries instead of requiring manual parity edits.
  - Drift must fail safe with explicit reason codes and remediation, otherwise
    OPEN/DONE contradictions silently accumulate and break automation trust.
  - One-time normalization is needed when historical artifacts already diverge;
    guardrails alone do not repair existing inconsistencies.
  - `/auto` and `/sprint-plan` behavior should remain bounded and deterministic;
    canonical status ownership complements backlog-drain controls but does not
    replace planning/sizing policies.

## R-0010

- **Date**: 2026-02-28
- **Topic**: Explicit bulk planning and bulk execution orchestration modes
- **Query**: How should workflow support high-autonomy multi-story delivery while
  preserving deterministic safety boundaries and fresh subagent isolation?
- **Sources**:
  - `.cursor/commands/auto.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/sprint-plan.md`
  - `docs/product/backlog.md` (`US-0023`, `US-0044`, `US-0045`)
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/tutorials/workflows/checkpointing-and-resuming
  - https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/patterns/scheduler-agent-supervisor
- **Findings**:
  - Existing `/auto` already covers multi-story continuation when backlog-drain
    controls are enabled, but operator intent remains implicit in flags.
  - Teams benefit from explicit command-level modes for high-impact behavior:
    dedicated bulk planning and bulk execution reduce ambiguity.
  - Deterministic bounded controls are required for both planning and execution
    bulk modes (selection policy, max items, block/skip policy, stop reasons).
  - Fresh subagent isolation should remain mandatory at fine granularity (at
    minimum per phase and per execute/qa cycle), even in bulk mode.
  - Safe defaults should preserve current single-scope behavior unless bulk mode
    is explicitly enabled.

## R-0011

- **Date**: 2026-03-01
- **Topic**: Deterministic bulk planning with bounded batch semantics
- **Query**: Which planning patterns support explicit bulk story-to-sprint planning
  with deterministic ordering, fairness, and bounded throughput controls?
- **Sources**:
  - https://www.growingscrummasters.com/keywords/priority-queues/
  - https://github.com/ori88c/starvation-free-priority-queue
  - https://arxiv.org/html/2507.15457v1
- **Findings**:
  - Priority-queue planning is practical when ordering policy is explicit and
    stable (for this workflow: priority, then backlog order).
  - Bounded batch size is a core safety control: it prevents runaway planning
    runs and keeps output reviewable in one cycle.
  - Fairness constraints (for example starvation-aware ordering) reduce the risk
    that low-priority stories never get planned in bulk mode.
  - Batch policy trade-offs are predictable: larger batches increase throughput
    but also increase review/coordination complexity; bounded limits should be
    first-class controls.
  - For this project, deterministic selection + bounded limits + explicit stop
    reasons are the minimum contract for `/sprint-plan --bulk`.

## R-0012

- **Date**: 2026-03-01
- **Topic**: Team-scoped bulk execution using lease/ownership patterns
- **Query**: Which execution-control patterns prevent duplicate work and enforce
  member-scoped task processing in concurrent bulk runs?
- **Sources**:
  - https://woodruff.dev/lease-pattern-in-net-a-lock-with-an-expiration-date-that-saves-your-data/
  - https://docs.dapr.io/developing-applications/building-blocks/distributed-lock/distributed-lock-api-overview/
  - https://www.c-sharpcorner.com/article/designing-a-distributed-job-locking-system-net-redis-sql/
- **Findings**:
  - Lease/ownership semantics are a strong fit for duplicate-work prevention:
    acquire atomically, renew while active, release or expire deterministically.
  - Expiring leases are safer than indefinite locks for long-running automation,
    because crashed/stalled workers do not hold ownership forever.
  - Ownership tokens are required so only the current owner can renew/release;
    this protects against accidental cross-member task mutation.
  - For this workflow, team context (`TEAM_MEMBER`, `ACTIVE_TASK_IDS`) should act
    as execution-scope filters before any task mutation in bulk mode.
  - When a task is out of scope or ownership cannot be validated, behavior should
    be deterministic skip/block with explicit reason code and breadcrumb output.

## R-0013

- **Date**: 2026-03-01
- **Topic**: Architecture tradeoffs for explicit bulk planning/execution modes
- **Query**: What architecture constraints keep explicit bulk planning/execution
  safe, deterministic, and team-collision resistant?

  - https://github.com/hibiken/asynq/wiki/Unique-Tasks
- **Findings**:
  - Explicit mode activation is a key control: high-impact bulk behavior should
    require direct operator intent, not implicit default paths.
  - Fairness-aware queueing concepts strengthen deterministic planning policies by
    preventing starvation when many lower-priority stories remain open.
  - Duplicate-work prevention patterns consistently rely on ownership semantics
    plus bounded lease/visibility windows and deterministic retry/skip handling.
  - Team-safe execution requires a strict pre-mutation scope filter and explicit
    reason-code behavior when ownership/scope checks fail.
  - For this workflow, the minimal safe contract is: explicit mode, bounded run
    controls, ownership/scope checks, and auditable breadcrumbs for each item.

## R-0014

- **Date**: 2026-03-01
- **Topic**: Canonical status ownership and drift normalization guardrails
- **Query**: Which workflow contract best prevents recurring OPEN/DONE drift
  across backlog, acceptance, and engineering state while remaining auditable?
- **Sources**:

  - `.cursor/commands/auto.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/execute.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/sprint-plan.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/release.md`
- **Findings**:
  - Status ownership must be singular; `backlog.md` is the canonical owner for
    `OPEN|DONE` story state.
  - Derived artifacts (`acceptance.md`, `state.md`) should be reconciled from
    canonical status at deterministic boundaries (release/reconciliation), not
    edited as independent authorities.
  - Historical drift needs a one-time normalization baseline with append-only
    audit output to avoid silent rewrites.
  - Guardrails must be target-scoped and non-destructive; broad global rewrites
    are unsafe for multi-sprint projects.
  - Contradictions at boundary should fail closed with explicit reason code and
    remediation guidance.

## R-0015

- **Date**: 2026-03-01
- **Topic**: Configurable guided intake mode with low-touch switch
- **Query**: How to provide proactive PO clarification behavior by default while
  allowing teams to disable overhead without losing baseline safety?
- **Sources**:
  - `docs/product/backlog.md` (`US-0033`)
  - `handoffs/po_to_tl.md` (US-0033 intake addendum)
  - `.cursor/commands/intake.md`
  - `.cursor/agents/po.mdc`
- **Findings**:
  - A single explicit switch is sufficient for operator intent and predictable
    intake interaction behavior.
  - Guided mode should be conditional: ask follow-up only when ambiguity blocks
    concrete acceptance criteria to avoid unnecessary friction.
  - Low-touch mode should remove proactive overhead but keep duplicate/overlap
    safety checks active.
  - Intake-time research belongs to guided mode and should be persisted with
    R-xxxx evidence for auditability.
  - Active/template parity is necessary because intake behavior is inherited from
    template guidance in newly installed repos.

## R-0016

- **Date**: 2026-03-01
- **Topic**: Optional cross-repo compatibility observability defaults and gating
- **Query**: How can workflow track API/contract compatibility across repos with
  zero-overhead defaults and deterministic critical gate behavior?
- **Sources**:
  - `docs/product/backlog.md` (`US-0034`)
  - `docs/engineering/architecture.md` (US-0034 section)
  - `.cursor/commands/intake.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/architecture.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/execute.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/qa.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/release.md`
- **Findings**:
  - Optional mode with explicit default-off toggle is the safest baseline for
    heterogeneous projects.
  - Compatibility observability needs canonical artifacts for signals/findings so
    QA and release can verify coverage deterministically.
  - Source declarations must be explicit (`repo/module/contract/docs`) to avoid
    ambiguous monitoring scope.
  - Critical unresolved findings require release decision gating only when the
    critical-gate policy is enabled.
  - Template parity is mandatory because command/rules/docs behavior is inherited
    during installation.

  - `.cursor/commands/sprint-plan.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/execute.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/qa.md`
  - `.cursor/commands/release.md`
- **Findings**:
  - Scope metadata must be explicit (`target_components`,
    `non_target_components`, `allowed_interface_touch`) when mode is enabled.
  - Planning must carry component scope into tasks to make QA verification
    deterministic.
  - Disabled mode must remain zero-overhead to avoid unnecessary ceremony in
    single-component projects.
  - Out-of-scope impact requires explicit escalation path and decision gate
    before release finalization when unresolved.
  - Scope report artifact improves auditability for unaffected-component checks.

    at progression boundaries (if evidence cannot be verified, do not proceed).
  - Per-phase isolation evidence must be **machine-checkable and minimal**:
    `phase_id`, `role`, `fresh_context_marker`, `timestamp`, `evidence_ref`.
  - “Fail securely” applies directly: on exception/uncertainty, treat isolation as
    **not proven** and block with deterministic diagnostics (reason code + remediation).
  - Release-path verification is an effective final control to prevent silent
    acceptance of process drift.
  - Resume checkpoints must preserve **isolation provenance** so continuation does
    not silently reuse prior context after interruption.

  - Microsoft Learn — Agent Framework workflow checkpoints: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/agent-framework/tutorials/workflows/checkpointing-and-resuming
- **Findings**:
  - **Phase isolation**: Enforced data isolation across execution phases with
    only explicitly passed inputs eliminates context pollution; each phase
    boundary should produce machine-checkable evidence (phase id, role,
    fresh-context marker, timestamp, evidence ref).
  - **Evidence schema**: Immutable audit trails require append-only recording,
    timestamps (ISO 8601), and stable references. Minimal schema for isolation
    evidence: `phase_id`, `role`, `fresh_context_marker`, `timestamp`,
    `evidence_ref`; optional (only if needed): `session_id`, `parent_phase`
    (resume provenance). For this repo, Git history already provides baseline
    integrity; cryptographic “tamper evidence” can remain optional unless an AC
    explicitly requires it.
  - **Fail-closed gates**: When enforcement cannot verify (e.g. missing or
    invalid isolation evidence), progression must be blocked with deterministic
    reason codes and remediation guidance; fail-closed is the secure default for
    compliance-sensitive boundaries (verify-work, release). (“Fail securely”:
    exceptions/unknowns are treated as **not authorized / not proven**.)
  - **Resume provenance**: Checkpoints should carry isolation provenance so
    continuation does not silently reuse context; deterministic resume
    requires replay-safe state and explicit start-phase + evidence refs in
    breadcrumbs.
  - **Canonical locations**: Evidence can live in phase-scoped artifacts
    (e.g. state.md sections, handoff footers, or a dedicated isolation log);
    single canonical index (e.g. in state.md or runbook) improves gate
    checkability.
- **Risks**:
  - Fail-closed at release can create operator friction if evidence writing is
    inconsistent; reason-code taxonomy and remediation steps are essential.
  - Resume provenance adds artifact surface; schema must stay minimal to avoid
    drift between written evidence and gate expectations.

    (US-0039 addendum), R-0005, DEC-0019
- **Findings**:
  - **Deterministic gate order**: Pre-deployment gates run before a stage;
    post-deployment gates run after completion and before the next stage.
    Fixed sequence (e.g. build → test → QA → UAT → release-note finalization)
    yields unambiguous audit trails; ordering must be documented and enforced
    so no gate is skipped or reordered implicitly (Azure Pipelines gates,
    InfoQ quality-gate sequencing).
  - **Evidence freshness and stale handling**: Stale or missing test/QA evidence
    must block release with explicit reason, not infer pass. Patterns: (1)
    require timestamp or run-id for latest evidence and define max age or
    “re-run required” policy; (2) quarantine/skip policies for flaky tests
    should not replace mandatory baseline pass; (3) remediation should point
    to re-run commands and evidence artifact locations (Harness test
    policies, Dagster freshness checks). For this workflow: gate reads
    canonical evidence artifacts (e.g. `tests/report.md`, `qa-findings.md`,
    `uat.json`); missing or stale evidence → block with deterministic code
    (e.g. `RELEASE_TEST_STALE`, `RELEASE_QA_EVIDENCE_MISSING`) and
    remediation (run TEST_COMMAND, re-run QA, complete verify-work).
  - **No-bypass defaults and override contract**: Default path must not skip
    gates. Override only via explicit decision gate: user approval, documented
    rationale (e.g. DEC-xxxx), and audit trail. GitLab and Guidewire show
    override as exception path with admin/approval; SonarQube associates one
    gate per project to avoid ambiguous bypass. For US-0039: no default
    bypass; any override requires explicit decision gate + rationale and
    optional `RELEASE_GATE_OVERRIDE_APPROVED` with DEC reference.
  - **Reason-code taxonomy and remediation**: Shared failure taxonomy improves
    MTTR (Thinking Loop CI taxonomies; Harness step failure strategy).
    Recommended codes for US-0039: `RELEASE_SPRINT_UNRESOLVED`,
    `RELEASE_TEST_FAILED`, `RELEASE_TEST_STALE`, `RELEASE_QA_EVIDENCE_MISSING`,
    `RELEASE_QA_BLOCKERS_OPEN`, `RELEASE_UAT_INCOMPLETE`, `RELEASE_UAT_FAILED`,
    `RELEASE_GATE_OVERRIDE_APPROVED` (with DEC ref). Each code must have
    documented remediation (what to fix, which artifact/command, and next
    step). Existing release command already uses RELEASE_* prefix; align
    handoff/runbook vocabulary with that set.
  - **Template parity risk**: Active and `template/` release/qa/execute
    guidance must stay behaviorally aligned so installed repos get the same
    release-safety contract. Drift between active and template causes
    inconsistent gate semantics for new installs. Mitigation: (1) list
    canonical files that must match (release.md, qa.md, execute.md,
    runbook sections, release-findings/reason-code docs); (2) include
    template-parity verification in release checklist or regression tests;
    (3) document gate order and reason codes in both active and template
    copies (Gruntwork/template drift patterns).
- **Risks**:
  - Stale-evidence thresholds (e.g. max age for test report) need a simple
    rule to avoid false blocks; prefer “evidence exists and passed” plus
    optional timestamp check rather than complex TTL.
  - Template parity is process/documentation; automated diff or checklist
    reduces but does not eliminate drift risk.

## R-0021

- **Date**: 2026-03-02
- **Topic**: Per-feature user guides and docs-as-code patterns
- **Query**: How to design optional, per-feature end-user guides (what it does, how to use it, limitations, troubleshooting) that integrate cleanly into a docs-as-code workflow without adding overhead when disabled.
- **Sources**:
  - https://docs.github.com/en/contributing/writing-for-github-docs/best-practices-for-github-docs

  - https://unmarkdown.com/blog/docs-as-code-2026
  - https://docs.gitscrum.com/en/best-practices/documentation-as-code/
- **Findings**:
  - Feature documentation works best when treated as code: version-controlled, reviewed, and deployed alongside the feature so behavior and docs change atomically.
  - Per-feature user guides are most helpful as short, task-focused how-to documents with a consistent schema: purpose, prerequisites, step-by-step usage, example, limitations, and troubleshooting.
  - Clear separation between conceptual docs, reference, and how-to guides avoids duplication with technical specs (e.g. Design Concept/CRS/Technical Spec) while keeping each artifact focused on a single audience.
  - Docs-as-code workflows prefer predictable, canonical locations and filenames (for example one guide per feature/story ID) plus lightweight frontmatter or metadata for linking and validation.
  - Quality and maintainability improve when user guides are part of “definition of done” for a feature and validated via simple structural checks (required sections present) instead of subjective content scoring.

## R-0022

- **Date**: 2026-03-02
- **Topic**: Canonical location, naming, and workflow gates for per-feature user guides
- **Query**: How should optional per-feature user guides be organized (directory structure, naming, definition-of-done, and validation) in a docs-as-code workflow while remaining flag-controlled and low-overhead when disabled?

  - https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/development/documentation/site_architecture/folder_structure.html
  - https://docs.gitlab.com/development/documentation/feature_flags/
- **Findings**:
  - Mature docs-as-code systems typically group user-facing docs by audience and feature area (for example `doc/user/<area>/<feature>.md`) rather than by ticket alone; story IDs are better treated as metadata/frontmatter and cross-reference anchors than as the sole filename pattern.
  - Per-feature guides for new capabilities are most effective as short, task-focused how-to documents that answer "what is it, what is it used for, and how do I use it?" with concrete examples and minimal implementation detail; this aligns with US-0032’s schema (purpose, prerequisites, usage steps, example, limitations, troubleshooting).
  - Definition-of-done patterns commonly require doc updates in the *same change* as the feature code (same PR/branch) so behavior and guides deploy atomically; for an optional mode, this requirement should be gated on the user-guide flag being enabled.
  - Directory conventions favor a canonical user-docs root (for example `docs/user-guides/`) with subfolders or filenames that reflect product area plus a stable identifier; for this repo, a simple and testable option is `docs/user-guides/<story-id>.md` with optional `<area>-US-xxxx.md` variants when the product surface grows.
  - Validation is usually structural rather than semantic: automated checks assert presence of required sections/headings and basic link/format sanity; deeper content quality remains a review concern. When user-guide mode is off, these checks should be skipped entirely to preserve zero-overhead behavior.
  - Feature-flagged capabilities are documented as normal user-facing features but annotated with flag metadata (name, default state, rollout history); this suggests that US-0032 should not hard-couple guide existence to feature-flag internals, but it may support optional frontmatter fields for flag references when relevant.

## R-0023

- **Date**: 2026-03-02
- **Topic**: Legacy DONE-story acceptance/traceability backfill guard and audit reporting
- **Query**: How to detect and repair backlog DONE vs acceptance/traceability drift with bounded, auditable backfill and ongoing guard; reason codes and report format.
- **Sources**:
  - `docs/product/backlog.md` (US-0045, US-0043), `docs/product/acceptance.md`
  - US-0017 and US-0030 as observed cases: DONE in backlog, unchecked in acceptance, not clearly in traceability/release artifacts
- **Findings**:
  - Canonical backlog DONE with unchecked acceptance or missing traceability is a recurring symptom when stories were completed before reconciliation/guardrails existed; one-time backfill plus ongoing guard closes the gap.
  - Deterministic normalization should be target-scoped (only stories where backlog says DONE and acceptance/traceability disagree), with explicit audit report entries (story ID, prior state, resolved state, reason code, evidence ref) and no broad destructive rewrite.
  - Reason-code vocabulary should include at least: `BACKLOG_DONE_ACCEPTANCE_UNCHECKED`, `BACKLOG_DONE_TRACEABILITY_MISSING`, `BACKLOG_DONE_RELEASE_ARTIFACT_MISSING` (or equivalent) so remediation is actionable.
  - Optional one-time backfill mode (explicit trigger) plus ongoing guard (e.g. at release/reconciliation boundaries or dedicated check command) keeps legacy repair separate from continuous prevention; template parity and regression coverage expectations should be explicit in ACs.
  - Scope stays consistent with US-0045 (canonical source, target-scoped repair) and US-0043 (release-boundary reconciliation); this story focuses on the guard/backfill procedure, audit report schema, and reason-code contract.
