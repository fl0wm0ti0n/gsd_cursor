# Vision

## Problem
AI coding assistants in Cursor lose context across sessions, produce fragmented work without structure, and lack a repeatable process for turning ideas into shipped software. Teams and solo developers face:
- Knowledge rot: critical decisions and context live only in chat history and get lost.
- No structured workflow: ad-hoc prompting leads to inconsistent quality.
- No pause/resume: long-running projects can't be paused and resumed cleanly.
- No escalation: AI makes high-impact decisions silently instead of asking.
- No quality chain: no automated checks between code and deployment.

## Audience
- Solo developers and small teams using Cursor IDE who want a structured, repeatable AI-assisted development workflow.
- Developers building projects that span multiple sessions and need persistent context.
- Teams that want role-based AI collaboration (PO, Tech Lead, Dev, QA, Release, Curator) without external orchestration tools.

## Value
- **One command to start**: user describes the idea, AI handles the rest (intake → discovery → architecture → sprint → execute → QA → release).
- **Artifact-first memory**: all decisions, state, and progress live in files — the repo is the memory, not the chat.
- **Memory trust check**: a read-only audit can detect when code changed without matching updates in state, decisions, backlog, acceptance, or handoffs.
- **Release doc integrity**: release readiness can enforce README/runbook parity when commands or flags evolve.
- **Pause/resume without drift**: checkpoint and resume at any point with clean context.
- **Mid-process auto continuation**: restart automation from a deterministic phase checkpoint and continue remaining phases with one command.
- **Decision gates**: AI escalates high-impact decisions to the user instead of guessing.
- **3-layer quality chain**: in-editor AI loop → local validate-and-push → CI auto-fix.
- **Policy-driven sync cadence**: optional phase/milestone-triggered sync can be configured, with safe default-off behavior and QA-first constraints.
- **Release safety gate**: release proceeds only after mandatory check-in tests and QA/UAT evidence pass deterministic gates.
- **Release history without overwrite**: per-sprint release notes preserve historical records instead of reusing a single mutable file.
- **Release queue visibility**: unreleased and released sprints are tracked in a canonical queue so pending release work is always explicit.
- **Spec-pack ready**: teams can optionally require Design Concept, CRS, and Technical Spec artifacts with near-zero overhead when disabled.
- **User-guide ready**: teams can optionally require user-friendly per-feature instructions with near-zero overhead when disabled.
- **Cross-repo aware**: optional observability can track module/API compatibility across repos and surface contract drift before release decisions.
- **Component-scoped safety**: optional scoped execution can focus work on selected components while explicitly protecting unaffected components.
- **Remote-ready by configuration**: optional remote execution uses a canonical `.cursor/remote.json` contract with fail-fast validation when enabled and zero overhead when disabled.
- **Drop-in installer**: one command installs the entire workflow into any repo.
- **Multiplatform**: available via npm, Chocolatey, and Homebrew.
- **Voice-friendly**: multilingual voice input as a first-class input layer.
- **Security-aware**: optional compliance review (GDPR, SOC2, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, ISO27001) at design and code level — zero overhead when disabled.
- **Knowledge-first decisions**: PO and architect research external docs, APIs, and best practices before deciding — curated knowledge persists across sessions and agents.
- **Adaptive intake depth**: guided intake can proactively ask clarifying questions and suggest options, or run low-touch mode via a switch when teams prefer direct capture.

## Look and Feel
- CLI-first: ASCII banner, clean terminal output.
- Slash-command driven: `/intake`, `/execute`, `/qa`, etc.
- Minimal footprint: zero npm dependencies, no build step.
- Convention over configuration: works out of the box with sensible defaults, configurable via scratchpad flags.

## UX References
- its-magic methodology: structured intake → rückfragen → specs → plan → execute → verify.
- Cursor IDE native: commands, rules, agents, hooks, skills.
- GitHub-style workflow: issues → PRs → CI → deploy.
