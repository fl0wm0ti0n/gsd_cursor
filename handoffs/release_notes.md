# Release Notes (Legacy Compatibility Pointer)

This file remains backward-compatible for workflows that read
`handoffs/release_notes.md` as the latest release summary.

Canonical sprint history now lives under:
- `handoffs/releases/Sxxxx-release-notes.md`

Canonical queue state now lives under:
- `handoffs/release_queue.md`

## Latest finalized release pointer

- **Latest released sprint:** `S0037`
- **Latest canonical notes:** `handoffs/releases/S0037-release-notes.md`
- **Latest release date:** 2026-03-14
- **Latest release story:** US-0058

## Unreleased queue visibility

Check `handoffs/release_queue.md` for all pending entries where `status=unreleased`
or `status=blocked` before finalization.

## Release readiness note (S0037)

- Sprint: `S0037`
- Story: `US-0058`
- Verify-work: PASS
- UAT status: PASS (`10/10`, `0` failed)
- QA findings: PASS with no blockers (`sprints/S0037/qa-findings.md`)
- Release readiness: Finalized as `released` in `handoffs/release_queue.md`
  with canonical sprint-scoped notes.

## Per-gate audit verdict (US-0039)

When `/release` runs, each gate (check-in test, QA, UAT, finalization) is recorded with:
- **verdict**: pass | fail | override
- **reason_code**: e.g. RELEASE_TEST_FAILED, RELEASE_QA_BLOCKERS_OPEN, RELEASE_UAT_INCOMPLETE, RELEASE_GATE_OVERRIDE_APPROVED
- **remediation**: short steps when not pass
- **evidence_refs**: paths to tests/report.md, qa-findings.md, uat.json, release-findings.md, DEC-xxxx

Canonical per-run gate snapshot lives in `sprints/Sxxxx/release-findings.md` and queue row `gate_snapshot`; TL/QA audit from those artifacts and `docs/engineering/state.md` checkpoints.

**Override path (US-0039)**: When a gate is overridden, record decision record ref (DEC-xxxx), rationale, approver, and risk acceptance in release-findings and gate_snapshot; use reason code `RELEASE_GATE_OVERRIDE_APPROVED`.

## Compatibility behavior contract

- Keep this file as a pointer/summary; do not treat it as canonical historical
  storage.
- `/release` must update sprint-scoped notes first, then refresh this pointer.
- Never delete or destructively rewrite historical sprint-scoped note files
  through this legacy path.
