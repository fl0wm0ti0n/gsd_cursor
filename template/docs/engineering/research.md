# Research

## Entry format

Each research entry uses the R-xxxx ID format with semi-structured fields.

**Required fields**: ID (R-xxxx), Date (YYYY-MM-DD), Topic (short description).
**Optional fields**: Query, Sources, Findings, Linked (US-xxxx/DEC-xxxx refs),
Confidence (high/medium/low, default: medium), Status (current/outdated/superseded,
default: current).

### Auto-increment convention

Assign the next sequential R-xxxx ID by incrementing from the highest existing
entry in this file. Before creating a new entry, read this file to determine the
current highest ID.

### Cross-referencing guidance

Reference research entries by ID in other artifacts using the format "per R-xxxx".
Examples:
- In decisions: "per R-0001, prompt-level isolation is unreliable"
- In architecture: "R-0003 confirms the library supports streaming"
- In handoffs: "see R-0002 for competitor analysis"

Agents, commands, and handoffs should cite entry IDs whenever research informed
a decision or recommendation.
